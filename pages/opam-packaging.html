<#def TITLE>Creating and Submitting a Package</#def>
<#include "incl/header.html">
<p>This page contains instructions covering the case of a simple Coq package
called <code>foo</code> with version <code>1.0.0</code>.
The full documentation on OPAM packages can be found on the <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a package</h2>

<p>First, go to the github page of <a href="https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive">opam-coq-archive</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">make a fork</a>.</p>

<p>The repository is now available in your personal github space.
Clone it locally by typing the following, where <code>user</code> is your github user name.</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:user/opam-coq-archive.git
cd opam-coq-archive
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the correct URL can also be found by clicking on the <em>clone</em> <em>or</em>
<em>download</em> button. Then create a directory named as follows</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>Remark that the package for <code>foo</code> is named <code>coq-foo</code> and that the directory
name is the package name followed by a dot followed by the version of the
package. Such directory has to contain at least 3 files</p>

<p>First, a text file called <code>url</code> pointing to the sources archive.
In our case <code>released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/url</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>http: &quot;https://github.com/user/foo/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz&quot;
checksum: &quot;d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The MD5 checksum is mandatory, and can be obtained with:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://github.com/user/foo/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz | md5sum
</code></pre>

<p>Second, a text file called <code>descr</code> containing a short
description of the package. In our case the contents of
<code>released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/descr</code> are:</p>

<pre><code>Foo is a Coq library doing wonders
</code></pre>

<p>Third, a text file called <code>opam</code> containing some metadata like build
instructions and dependencies. In our case
<code>released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/opam</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>opam-version: &quot;1.2&quot;
maintainer: &quot;your@email.address&quot;
homepage: &quot;https://github.com/you/foo&quot;
dev-repo: &quot;https://github.com/you/foo.git&quot;
bug-reports: &quot;https://github.com/you/foo/issues&quot;
authors: [&quot;Your Name&quot;]
license: &quot;MIT&quot;
build: [
  [&quot;coq_makefile -R . Foo -o Makefile *.v&quot;]
  [make &quot;-j%{jobs}%&quot;]
]
install: [
  [make &quot;install&quot;]
]
remove: [&quot;rm&quot; &quot;-R&quot; &quot;%{lib}%/coq/user-contrib/Foo&quot;]
depends: [
  &quot;coq&quot; {&gt;= &quot;8.5&quot; &amp; &lt; &quot;8.6~&quot;}
]
tags: [
  &quot;keyword:fooish&quot;
  &quot;category:Miscellaneous/Coq Extensions&quot;
  &quot;date:2016-09-01&quot;
  &quot;logpath:Foo&quot;
]
</code></pre>

<p>One can now git commit the new package</p>

<pre><code>git add released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0
git commit -m 'Packaging foo version 1.0.0'
</code></pre>

<h2>Testing your new package</h2>

<p>The preliminary step is to lint your <code>opam</code> file as follows</p>

<pre><code>opam lint released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/opam
</code></pre>

<p>Once no more errors are given, the best way to test your package is to add your
local clone of <code>opam-coq-archive</code> to opam as follows, and then run <code>opam
install</code> on your new package in verbose mode:</p>

<pre><code>opam repo add test ./released
opam install -v coq-foo
</code></pre>

<p>If things go wrong, after having fixed the problem and before trying again
to install the package you shall run <code>opam update</code>.</p>

<h2>Submitting your new package</h2>

<p>Submission happens by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">creating a pull request</a>
 on the <a href="https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive">opam-coq-archive repository</a>.</p>

<p>First push your changes to you personal fork</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Then visit the github page of your personal fork and click on the
<em>new</em> <em>pull</em> <em>request</em> button.</p>

<h2>Making good packages</h2>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<ol>
<li>The archive follows a <a href="opam-layout.html">layout</a>.
Regular packages shall be placed in the <code>released</code> directory.
One can also write packages that install development branches of
a software. In that case <code>extra-dev</code> directory has to be used
and the version has to end in <code>dev</code> like <code>mybranch.dev</code>.</li>
<li>The package name should start with <code>coq-</code>, for example <code>coq-color</code> or
<code>coq-interval</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>tags</code> field in the <code>opam</code> file can contain additional metadata
(like a categorization or the Coq logical path the package populates)
as described in <a href="https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/003-opam-metadata.md">CEP3</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Rules of thumb</h3>

<p>The released repository shall contain software that works with a stable version
of Coq. Packages are maintained by their corresponding authors or by the Coq
team. Dependencies must be expressed in a conservative way providing both
lower and upper bounds to version numbers. This way all installable packages
(i.e. with satisfiable constraints) shall compile successfully.</p>

<p>We advise package authors to make sure that the following conditions are
met:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Maintained</em> by the Coq team or by an external author (contact email
address in the <code>author:</code> field in OPAM metadata)</li>
<li><em>Released</em> with a version number and a tar ball (that is mirrored on the Coq
OPAM archive website)</li>
<li>Includes a <em>Changelog</em> that lists the main changes between any
two versions part of this archive</li>
<li>The <em>License</em> must allow free redistribution (even if it is not a free
software license)</li>
<li><em>No</em> <em>Admitted</em> proofs</li>
<li>All <em>Axioms</em> used are documented</li>
<li>ML code is <em>reviewed</em> by a Coq developer</li>
<li><em>Documentation</em> should be available (see the <code>doc:</code> field in the
OPAM metadata)</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case the Coq development team keeps the right to refuse the integration
of a package or remove any package at any time.</p>

<h3>Updating a package to a new version</h3>

<ol>
<li>Like the initial version, the new version of the package should be
submitted in a pull request and is encouraged to follow the
guidelines above</li>
<li>We recommend to ease the transition from the old to the new version by
providing a transition strategy (a document helping a user to perform the
switch: e.g. documenting all renamings).</li>
<li>The old version stays in the repository.</li>
</ol>
