<#def TITLE>Creating and Submitting a Package</#def>
<#include "incl/header.html">
<p>This page contains instructions to submit a simple example Coq package
called <code>foo</code> at version <code>1.0.0</code>.
The full documentation on Opam packages can be found on the
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Packaging.html">Opam web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Package layout</h2>

<p>For simplicity, we will assume that the Coq project you want to package
contains a <code>Makefile</code> providing the following commands:
</p>

<pre><code>make          # Build the package
make install  # Install the package
</code></pre>

<details>
  <summary>Click here to see a minimal example <code>Makefile</code>.
  </summary>
<pre><code>build: Makefile.coq
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.coq

install: Makefile.coq
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.coq install

Makefile.coq: _CoqProject
	coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o $@
</code></pre>
<p>
See also the Reference Manual on
<a href="/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-coq-project-with-coq-makefile">building a Coq project with <code>coq_makefile</code></a>.
</p>
</details>

The project must be available to download as an archive. For example,
if your repository is hosted on GitHub, tag the commit corresponding to the
<code>1.0.0</code> version of your project:

<pre><code>git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
</code></pre>

If your repository is on GitHub at <code>$YOU/foo</code> (where <code>$YOU</code> is
your GitHub user name), the archive corresponding to the tag <code>1.0.0</code>
can be downloaded from this URL:
<code>https://github.com/$YOU/foo/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz</code>, using
<code>curl -L</code> or your browser for example.

<h2>The Opam archive for Coq</h2>

<p>Opam packages live in this repository:
<a href="https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive">opam-coq-archive</a>.
New packages are submitted through GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Clone the repository</h3>

<p>Follow this section if this is your first submission to
the Opam archive to Coq.</p>

<p>First, go to the GitHub page of <a href="https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive">opam-coq-archive</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">make a fork</a>.</p>

<p>The repository is now available in your personal GitHub space.
Clone it locally by typing the following, where <code>$YOU</code> is your GitHub user name.
The correct URL in the third line can also be found by clicking on the
<em>clone or download</em> button on the GitHub page of your fork.
</p>

<p>This creates a clone with two remotes, one for the official archive,
called <code>upstream</code>, and one for your fork, called <code>origin</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive -o upstream
cd opam-coq-archive
git remote add origin https://github.com/$YOU/opam-coq-archive
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fetch-upstream">Update the repository</h3>

<p>If you already have a clone of <code>opam-coq-archive</code>, for example
because this is not your first submission, the following command updates
the <code>upstream</code> remote with all changes since your last update
or initial clone.</p>

<pre><code>git fetch upstream
</code></pre>

<h3>Create a package definition file</h3>

<p>Create a new branch named <code>coq-foo.1.0.0</code> based on
<code>upstream/master</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b coq-foo.1.0.0 upstream/master
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>opam-coq-archive</code> directory, create a sub-directory named as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>The Opam package is thus named <code>coq-foo</code> and the sub-directory name
is the package name followed by a dot followed by the version of the
package.</p>

<p>In that directory, create a text file called <code>opam</code>,
which will contain the package's metadata (build instructions, dependencies, etc.).
Here is a template for <code>released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/opam</code>:</p>

<pre><code>opam-version: &quot;2.0&quot;

]
</code></pre>

<p>
The last two fields are of particular interest:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>url</code> section describes where to find your package.
    It must have at least the following fields:
    the <code>src</code> field with the URL of the package archive,
    and the <code>checksum</code> field with the checksum of that archive
    prefixed by <code>sha256=</code>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <code>tags</code> field contains Coq-specific metadata.
    See also the <a href="https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/003-opam-metadata.md">CEP on Opam metadata</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a description of the other fields, see the <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html#Package-definitions">relevant section of the Opam Manual</a>.

<p>The checksum can be obtained with:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://github.com/$YOU/foo/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz | sha256sum
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>opam</code> file, the checksum must be prefixed with the
hashing algorithm, here <code>sha256=</code>. (<code>sha512=</code>, and
<code>md5=</code> are also supported.)
</p>

<p>Commit the new <code>opam</code> file:
</p>

<pre><code>git add released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/opam
git commit -m 'Package coq-foo.1.0.0'
</code></pre>

<h3>Test your new package</h3>

<p>The preliminary step is to lint your <code>opam</code> file as follows</p>

<pre><code>opam lint released/packages/coq-foo/coq-foo.1.0.0/opam
</code></pre>

<p>Once no more errors are given, the best way to test your package is to add your
local clone of <code>opam-coq-archive</code> to opam as follows, and then run <code>opam
install</code> on your new package in verbose mode:</p>

<pre><code>opam repo add test ./released
opam install -v coq-foo
</code></pre>

<p>If things go wrong, after having fixed the problem and before trying again
to install the package, run <code>opam update</code>.</p>

<h3>Submit your new package</h3>

<p>Submission happens by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">creating a pull request</a>
 on the <a href="https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive">opam-coq-archive repository</a>.</p>

<p>First push your changes to your personal fork:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin coq-foo.1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>Then visit the GitHub page of your personal fork and click on the
<em>new pull request</em> button.</p>

<h2>Making good packages</h2>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<ol>
<li>The archive follows a <a href="opam-layout.html">layout</a>.
Regular packages shall be placed in the <code>released</code> directory.
One can also write packages that install development branches of
a software. In that case <code>extra-dev</code> directory has to be used
and the version has to end in <code>dev</code> like <code>mybranch.dev</code>.</li>
<li>The package name should start with <code>coq-</code>, for example <code>coq-color</code> or
<code>coq-interval</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>tags</code> field in the <code>opam</code> file can contain additional metadata
(like a categorization or the Coq logical path the package populates)
as described in <a href="https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/003-opam-metadata.md">CEP3</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Rules of thumb</h3>

<p>The released repository shall contain software that works with a stable version
of Coq. Packages are maintained by their corresponding authors or by the Coq
team. Dependencies must be expressed in a conservative way providing both
lower and upper bounds to version numbers. This way all installable packages
(i.e. with satisfiable constraints) shall compile successfully.</p>

<p>We advise package authors to make sure that the following conditions are
met:</p>

<ol>
<li>Includes a <em>Changelog</em> that lists the main changes between any
two versions part of this archive</li>
<li>The <em>License</em> must allow free redistribution (even if it is not a free
software license)</li>
<li><em>No</em> <em>Admitted</em> proofs</li>
<li>All <em>Axioms</em> used are documented</li>
<li>ML code is <em>reviewed</em> by a Coq developer</li>
<li><em>Documentation</em> should be available (see the <code>doc:</code> field in the
Opam metadata)</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case the Coq development team keeps the right to refuse the integration
of a package or remove any package at any time.</p>

<h3>Updating a package to a new version</h3>

<ol>
<li>Like the initial version, the new version of the package should be
submitted in a pull request and is encouraged to follow the
guidelines above</li>
<li>We recommend to ease the transition from the old to the new version by
providing a transition strategy (a document helping a user to perform the
switch: e.g. documenting all renamings).</li>
<li>The old version stays in the repository.</li>
</ol>
