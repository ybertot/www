<p>Coq implements a program specification and mathematical higher-level language called <em>Gallina</em> that is based on an expressive formal language called the <em>Calculus of Inductive Constructions</em> that itself combines both a higher-order logic and a richly-typed functional programming language. Through a <em>vernacular</em> language of commands, Coq allows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>to define functions or predicates, that can be evaluated efficiently;</li>
      <li>to state mathematical theorems and software specifications;</li>
      <li>to interactively develop formal proofs of these theorems;</li>
      <li>to machine-check these proofs by a relatively small certification "kernel";</li>
      <li>to extract certified programs to languages like OCaml, Haskell or Scheme.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>As a proof development system, Coq provides interactive proof
    methods, decision and semi-decision
    algorithms, and a <em>tactic</em> language for letting the user define its own proof methods. Connection with external computer algebra system or theorem provers is available.</p>

    <p> As a platform for the formalization of mathematics or the development of programs, Coq provides support for high-level notations, implicit contents and various other useful kinds of macros.</p>

    <p> Coq comes with libraries for efficient arithmetics in N, Z and Q,
    libraries about lists, finite sets and finite maps, libraries on
    abstract sets, relations, classical analysis, etc.</p>

    <p> Coq is released with:</p>
      <ul>

      <li>a graphical user interface based on gtk (CoqIDE) (<a

    <p>Coq is the result of more than 30 years of research. It started in
    1984 from an implementation of the Calculus of Constructions at
    INRIA-Rocquencourt by Thierry Coquand and Gérard Huet. In 1991,
    Christine Paulin extended it to the Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions.

    All in all, more than 200 people have contributed to the
    development of Coq (see
    our <a href="<#CURRENTCREDITSURL>">credits</a> file,
    the <a href="/refman/history.html">history</a>
    and <a href="/refman/changes.html">recent changes</a> chapters in
    the Coq Reference Manual or the
    synthetic <a href="/who-did-what-in-coq">who did what</a>
