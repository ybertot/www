<p>The beta version of Coq 8.2 brings Haskell-style type classes, various
evolutions of the arithmetic libraries, and many other various
improvements and extensions regarding the module system, tactics,
syntax, etc.</p>

<p>The support for Haskell-style type classes has been contributed by
M. Sozeau and is documented in <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual024.html">chapter
18</a> of the reference manual.</p>

<p>The evolutions of the arithmetic libraries cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  use of native arithmetic in the bytecode-based fast evaluator of Coq
  (A. Spiwack),
  </li>
  <li>
  new library on efficient 31-bits integer and word-based unbounded 
  integers (L. Théry, B. Grégoire, A. Spiwack, P. Letouzey),
  </li>
  <li>
  new library on axiomatic natural, cyclic and unbounded integer
  numbers (E. Makarov),
  </li>
  <li>
  new framework "micromega" for solving systems of inequalities in Z, Q, R,
  possibly relying on external tools for non linear systems (F. Besson).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual007.html">module
system</a> has been extended with the include feature, sharing of
common submodules, functorial signature application and on-demand
parameter inlining (E. Soubiran).</p>


<p>At the level of tactics, Coq 8.2 offers a more efficient
implementation of <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual029.html">setoid
rewrite</a>, new support for constant unfolding in apply, new <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual011.html#@tactic84">dependent
induction</a>, <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual011.html#@tactic69">induction</a>/<a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual011.html#@tactic75">destruct</a>
with "in" clause and "e" variants, support for <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual011.html#@tactic94">iteration
and "at" clause in rewrite</a>, new variants of <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual011.html#@tactic82">introduction
patterns</a>, support for implicit contents and coercions in the
"with" clauses, use of type informations in unification (P. Letouzey,
M. Sozeau, S. Glondu, E. Makarov, H. Herbelin). The mathematical proof
language is documented in <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual014.html">chapter
11</a> of the reference manual (P. Corbineau).</p>

<p>Coq 8.2 also offers miscellaneous syntax extensions and improved
features: <a href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual004.html#@default69">destructing let</a>, better type inference,
inference of matching return clause, detection of impossible clause in
dependent pattern-matching, detection of decreasing argument in
fixpoints, improved <a href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual027.html">Program</a> and <a href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual004.html#toc15">Function</a>
features, new ways to work with <a href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual004.html#toc19">implicit arguments</a>, and
various other auxiliary features (M. Sozeau, P. Letouzey,
H. Herbelin). It also provides automatic generation of decidable
equality (V. Siles).</p>

<p>Finally, Coq comes with a new stand-alone <a
href="distrib/current/refman//Reference-Manual017.html#toc89">checker</a>
for cross-certification of vo-files (B. Barras).</p>

<p>For all other changes, see the <a href="distrib/current/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file.</p>

<p>As far as we could judge, the major sources of incompatibilities come
from the new implementation of setoid rewrite and, marginally, from
the support of constant unfolding in apply. A secondary source comes
from some bug fixes and from changes in specific libraries. See the <a
href="distrib/current/COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a> file for details and smooth
migration recommendations. We are interested in feedback on the
upgrading problems that may be encountered.</p>

<p>The documentation is available <a href="doc/refman/">online</a>.</p>

new one on the <a href="/bugs">bug
tracker</a>. General questions or remarks can be sent to

<p>A few changes in the Objective Caml interfaces of Coq are
documented in the file dev/doc/changes.txt of Coq source archive.</p>
