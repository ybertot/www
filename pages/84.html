<p>The Coq workshop brings together Coq users, developers and
contributors.  The previous edition was held in Munich in 2009, as a <a href="/coq-workshop/2009">satellite workshop of the TPHOLs conference</a>. For the next edition, the organization has yet to be fixed, but there will be a call for papers and probably invited talks and tutorials.</p>


<br><br>
<p><em>The workshop is supported by the Coq Technological Development Action (at INRIA) which thanks the Technical University of Munich for its local support and for pre-publishing the <a href="/files/coq-workshop-TUM-I0919.pdf">proceedings. </a></em>.</p>
