<span class="caps">Coq</span> is a Proof Assistant for a Logical Framework known as the Calculus
of Inductive Constructions. It allows the interactive construction of
formal proofs, and also the manipulation of functional programs 
consistently with their specifications. It runs as a computer program
on many architectures.
It is available with a variety of user interfaces. The present
document does not attempt to present a comprehensive view of all the
possibilities of <span class="caps">Coq</span>, but rather to present in the most elementary
manner a tutorial on the basic specification language, called Gallina,
in which formal axiomatisations may be developed, and on the main
proof tools. For more advanced information, the reader could refer to
the <span class="caps">Coq</span> Reference Manual or the <span class="italic">Coq'Art</span>, a new book by Y.
Bertot and P. Castéran on practical uses of the <span class="caps">Coq</span> system.<br/>
<br/>
Coq can be used from a standard teletype-like shell window but
preferably through the graphical user interface
CoqIde<span class="sup"><a name="text1" href="#note1">1</a></span >.<br/>
<br/>
Instructions on installation procedures, as well as more comprehensive
documentation, may be found in the standard distribution of <span class="caps">Coq</span>,
which may be obtained from <span class="caps">Coq</span> web site <a href="http://logical.futurs.inria.fr/coq">http://logical.futurs.inria.fr/coq</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the following, we assume that <span class="caps">Coq</span>&nbsp; is called from a standard
teletype-like shell window. All examples preceded by the prompting
sequence <code>Coq &lt; </code> represent user input, terminated by a
period. <br/>
<br/>
The following lines usually show <span class="caps">Coq</span>'s answer as it appears on the
users screen. When used from a graphical user interface such as
CoqIde, the prompt is not displayed: user input is given in one window
and <span class="caps">Coq</span>'s answers are displayed in a different window.<br/>
<br/>
The sequence of such examples is a valid <span class="caps">Coq</span>&nbsp;
session, unless otherwise specified. This version of the tutorial has
been prepared on a PC workstation running Linux. The standard
invocation of <span class="caps">Coq</span> delivers a message such as:<br/>
