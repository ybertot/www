Coq is a proof assistant. It means that it is designed to develop
mathematical proofs, and especially to write formal specifications,
programs and proofs that programs comply to their specifications. An
interesting additional feature of Coq is that it can automatically extract
executable programs from specifications, as either <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/">Objective Caml</a> or <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>
source code.
<br><br>
Properties, programs and proofs are formalized in the
same language called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC). Then, all logical judgments in Coq are typing judgments: the very heart of Coq is in fact a <em>type</em>-checking algorithm.

<h3>The language of Coq</h3>

Coq objects are sorted into two categories: the <tt>Prop</tt> <em>sort</em> and the <tt>Type</tt> <em>sort</em>:

<ul>
<li><tt>Prop</tt> is the sort for propositions, i.e. well-formed propositions are of <em>type</em> <tt>Prop</tt>. Typical propositions are:
<pre>
  ? A B : Prop, A /\ B -> B \/ B
  ? x y : Z, x * y = 0 -> x = 0 \/ y = 0
</pre>
and new predicates can be defined either inductively, e.g.:
<pre>
  Inductive even : N -> Prop :=
  | even_0 : even 0
  | even_S n : odd n -> even (n + 1)
  with odd : N -> Prop :=
  | odd_S n : even n -> odd (n + 1).
</pre>
or by abstracting over other existing propositions, e.g.:
<br>
<pre>
  Definition divide (x y:N) := ? z, x * z = y.
  Definition prime x := ? y, divide y x -> y = 1 \/ y = x.
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>Type</tt> is the sort for datatypes and mathematical structures, i.e. well-formed types or structures are of <em>type</em> <tt>Type</tt>. Here is e.g. a basic example of type:
<pre>
  Z -> Z * Z
</pre>
Types can be inductive structures, e.g.:
<pre>
  Inductive nat : Set :=
  | 0 : nat
  | S : nat -> nat.

  Inductive list (A:Type) : Type :=
  | nil : list A
  | cons : A -> list A -> list A.
</pre>
or types for tuples, e.g.:
<pre>
  Structure monoid := { 
    dom : Type ; 
    op : dom -> dom -> dom where "x * y" := (op x y); 
    id : dom where "1" := id; 
    assoc : ? x y z, x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z ; 
    left_neutral : ? x, 1 * x = x ;
    right_neutral : ? x, x * 1 = x 
  }.
</pre>
or a form of subset types called ?-types, e.g. the type of even natural numbers:
<pre>
  {n : N | even n}
</pre>

Coq implements a functional programming language supporting these types. For instance, the pairing function of type <tt>Z -> Z * Z</tt> is written <tt>fun x => (x,x)</tt> and <tt>cons (S (S O)) (cons (S O) nil)</tt> (shortened to <tt>2::1::nil</tt> in Coq) denotes a list of type <tt>list nat</tt> made of the two elements 2 and 1.
<br>
Using ?-types, a sorting function over lists of natural numbers can be given the type:
<pre>
  sort : ? (l : list nat), {l' : list nat | sorted l' /\ same_elements l l'}
</pre>
where <tt>sorted</tt> is a predicate that expresses that a list is sorted; and <tt>all_elements</tt> says if two lists contain the same elements. On the contrary, a sorting function in a "poor" type system could only be given the following less informative type:
<pre>
  sort : list nat -> list nat
</pre>

Such a type (specification) enforces the user to write the proofs of predicates <tt>sorted l'</tt> and <tt>same_elements l l'</tt> when writing a implementation for the function <tt>sort</tt>.
<br><br>
Then, functions over inductive types are expressed using a case
analysis:

<pre>
  Fixpoint plus (n m:nat) {struct n} : nat :=
    match n with
    | O => m
    | S p => S (p + m)
    end
  where "p + m" := (plus p m).
</pre>

Coq can now be used as an interactive evaluator. Issuing the command 
<pre>
  Eval compute in (43+55)
</pre>
(where 43 and 55 denote the natural numbers with respectively 43 and 55 successors) returns
<pre>
  98 : nat
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Proving in coq</h3>

Proof development in Coq is done through a language of tactics that 
allows a user-guided proof process.
At the end, the curious user can check that tactics build lambda-terms. For example the tactic
<tt>intro n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is of type <tt>nat</tt>, builds the term (with a hole):

<pre>
  fun (n:nat) => _ 
</pre>
where _ represents a term that will be constructed after, using other
tactics.
<br><br>
Here is an example of a proof in the Coq system:

<pre>
  Inductive seq : nat -> Set :=
  | niln : seq 0
  | consn : forall n : nat, nat -> seq n -> seq (S n).

  Fixpoint length (n : nat) (s : seq n) {struct s} : nat := 
    match s with
    | niln => 0
    | consn i _ s' => S (length i s')
    end.

  Theorem length_corr : forall (n : nat) (s : seq n), length n s = n.
  Proof.
    intros n s.

    (* reasoning by induction over s. Then, we have two new goals
       corresponding on the case analysis about s (either it is 
       niln or some consn *)
    induction s.

      (* We are in the case where s is void. We can reduce the 
         term: length 0 niln *)
      simpl. 

      (* We obtain the goal 0 = 0. *)
      trivial.

      (* now, we treat the case s = consn n e s with induction 
         hypothesis IHs *)
      simpl. 

      (* The induction hypothesis has type length n s = n. 
         So we can use it to perform some rewriting in the goal: *)
      rewrite IHs. 

      (* Now the goal is the trivial equality: S n = S n *)
      trivial.

    (* Now all sub cases are closed, we perform the ultimate
       step: typing the term built using tactics and save it as
       a witness of the theorem. *)
  Qed.

Using the Print command, the user can look at the proof-term generated using the tactics:

<pre>
  length_corr =
    fun (n : nat) (s : seq n) =>
      seq_ind (fun (n0 : nat) (s0 : seq n0) => length n0 s0 = n0) 
        (refl_equal 0)
        (fun (n0 _ : nat) (s0 : seq n0) (IHs : length n0 s0 = n0) =>
          eq_ind_r 
            (fun n2 : nat => S n2 = S n0) 
            (refl_equal (S n0)) IHs) n s
  : forall (n : nat) (s : seq n), length n s = n
</pre>
